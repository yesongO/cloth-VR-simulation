# Cloth VR Project

A real-time cloth simulation extended to VR using Three.js and WebXR.  
This project allows users to interact with a dynamic cloth using VR controllers in a browser environment.

This project is an extended version of the cloth simulation demo from Matthias Müller's Ten Minute Physics series.
Original project by Matthias Müller.
